    "## Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to demonstrate application of SQL queries to answer current questions of the organization to guide immediate action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "[Chinook](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database), a hypothetical record store, has hired our analytics team to assist their decision-making.  We are provided access to the company's SQLite database and schema and assigned the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Of the following 4 artists of a newly signed record label, which 3 should have albums added to the store based on top-selling genres in the USA?  \n",
    "\n",
    "| Artist Name | Genre |\n",
    "| ----------- | ----- |\n",
    "| Regal | Hip-Hop |\n",
    "| Red Tone | Punk |\n",
    "| Meteor and the Girls | Pop |\n",
    "| Slim Jim Bites | Blues |\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. Based on analysis of each sales agent's customer purchases, are any sales agents outperforming or underperforming the group?\n",
    "\n",
    "3\\. Provide a customer sales analysis by country, including:\n",
    "- total number of customers\n",
    "- total value of sales\n",
    "- average value of sales per customer\n",
    "- average order values\n",
    "\n",
    "4\\. Analyze indivual track vs whole album purchases to advise whether shifting to offering only individual most popular tracks would increase ROI.  The company has instructed that albums with only a few total tracks may be excluded from the analysis."

    "- Over 81% of invoices are for purchases of individual tracks.\n",
